I am currently finishing a PhD in pure mathematics at University of Cambridge in which I am researching the naturality of the Integral Logarithm in Algebraic Number Theory with Dr Christopher Brookes. I graduated with three firsts and a distinction in my degrees (near the top of the Tripos rankings in Parts II and III). I then took a sabbatical from research and gained extensive working experience as a maths educator for ages 11-22 (both in the classroom and management). This has included pastoral work and curriculum development. As a US Permanent Resident I am now looking for opportunities that leverage my skills in pure mathematics, applied analysis, and education (in Europe or North America) as I transition into an analyst role or the tech world.
