A friend recently shared an article by Basel Farag, the influential iOS Engineer, who is wanring against viewing teaching coding as a panacea for society.

*Donâ€™t get me wrong; I do believe that engineering and programming are important skills. But only in the right context, and only for the type of person willing to put in the necessary blood, sweat and tears to succeed. The same could be said of many other skills. I would no more urge everyone to learn to program than I would urge everyone to learn to plumb.*

His article explores the idea that code and tech must grow from a passion and a clear [motivation](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/).
