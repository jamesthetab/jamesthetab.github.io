For the last decade I've been moving in similar Cambridge circles to [Rob Percival](http://www.robpercival.co.uk). I finally met the maths teacher turned coding guru (over 200,000 students have taken his online learn to code courses) at a school prize giving evening where he was the guest speaker. 

What he said to the spongy young minds in the room went very much against much of traditional British education (striving to be the very best you can in one area) and he described how his life was transoformed by the realisation that although he might not be the best mathematician; best teacher; or best hacker in the world, the package he offered as a combination of all three was much rarer than they were individually, and this is where he has positioned himself with these courses.

It was good for the students to hear that they have more than one chance in life, and it was nice for me to reflect on how taking a sabatical from research for family health reasons, and during that time throwing myself into education and curriculum development, might actually be useful in my mathematical life if I can successfully combine the two.
